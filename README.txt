This project is a semantic recommender system built using the cleaned Netflix titles dataset. It takes a Netflix movie or TV show as input and returns similar Netflix content based on meaning rather than keywords. To do this, I combined each title’s name, genres, and description into one text field and generated sentence embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from SentenceTransformers. User input goes through fuzzy matching so even misspelled titles (like “walkin dead”) map to the closest real Netflix title. I then compute cosine similarity between the matched title’s embedding and all other embeddings to rank the most similar items. The system returns a table of recommended Netflix titles along with their genres, descriptions, and similarity scores. A simple Gradio interface wraps the recommender so users can type a title, choose how many recommendations they want, and instantly see the results. This version is limited to the Netflix dataset, but can be expanded later to support non-Netflix titles or larger movie databases.
